This data race detection tool was built upon [SVF](https://github.com/SVF-tools/SVF)'s MTA module for Michael Liu and Vi Nguyen's thesis project at UNSW. It was developed to be utilised with the Eclipse plug-in we developed [here](https://github.com/yuleisui/SVF-MTA-EclipsePlugin).

You can read our [report](https://github.com/mykou/SVF-Data-Race-Detection-Tool/blob/master/ThesisReport.pdf) to understand our methodology and justification.
